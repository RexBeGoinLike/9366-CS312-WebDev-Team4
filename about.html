            <h2>Welcome to THRIVE</h2>
            <p>
                THRIVE is a movement born from the belief that inequality — whether in income,
                education, health, or culture — should never define our nation. Inspired by global
                principles of human dignity and equity, we work to empower marginalized communities
                across the Philippines to live with justice, opportunity, and voice.

                <p>
                    Lumad elders from the Cordillera region recount decades of displacement due to
                    mining. The community now monitors all proposed mining permits, files legal cases,
                    and is restoring degraded ancestral lands with native tree planting.

                    In Palawan and other remote provinces, mobile healthcare units serve hundreds of
                    patients weekly — offering checkups, maternal care, and free medicines. Local
                    volunteers are essential to these life-saving missions.
