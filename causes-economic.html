        <h2>Economic Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Economic forces play a major role in shaping inequality in the Philippines. Below are the main factors with detailed explanations.</p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <h3>Unequal distribution of wealth (richest families and corporations control much of the economy)
        </h3>
        <p>The Philippines continues to struggle with the unequal distribution of wealth, where a small percentage of the population controls a large share of the nation’s resources. Studies reveal that the wealthiest families and corporations dominate the economy, particularly in industries like real estate, banking, energy, retail, and telecommunications. These big businesses are often linked to political dynasties, giving them not only economic power but also political influence. Their dominance creates barriers for smaller businesses and ordinary workers who struggle to access the same opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>In Metro Manila, the effects of wealth concentration are highly visible. Expensive condominiums, luxury malls, and business districts exist side by side with slum areas and informal settlements. While the rich enjoy exclusive subdivisions and access to global markets, many Filipinos live below the poverty line, earning barely enough to cover food and transportation. This sharp divide reflects how wealth is not evenly distributed across the population.
        </p>
        <p>One root cause of this inequality is the limited competition in key industries. Many sectors are controlled by only a handful of conglomerates, making it hard for new players to enter. This limits innovation and keeps prices high, further burdening ordinary consumers. Meanwhile, workers employed in these corporations often earn only modest salaries compared to the massive profits generated.
        </p>
        <p>Wealth inequality is also reinforced by tax systems that are criticized for being more favorable to large businesses than to low-income workers. Corruption and poor governance make the problem worse, as public funds that could help the poor are sometimes misused. In rural areas, families dependent on farming face uncertain incomes, while urban elite families continue to expand their businesses.</p>
        <p>This unequal distribution of wealth has serious social consequences. It limits social mobility, as children from poor families have fewer chances to access quality education and health care. It also fuels discontent and migration, as people leave the country to seek better opportunities abroad. Without strong policies to address wealth concentration, such as progressive taxation, better support for small enterprises, and fairer labor practices, inequality in the Philippines will persist and hinder true national development.

        <h3>Limited Access to High Paying Jobs Outside Major Urban Centers</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest economic inequalities in the Philippines is the limited access to high-paying jobs outside Metro Manila and other major cities. Most lucrative careers in finance, technology, real estate, and multinational companies are concentrated in business districts such as Makati, Bonifacio Global City, and Ortigas. Meanwhile, provinces and rural towns offer fewer opportunities, often restricted to farming, fishing, or small-scale trade. This uneven distribution of jobs forces many people in the countryside to settle for low-paying work, regardless of their skills or education.
        </p>
        <p>Many young professionals migrate to cities in search of higher wages, leading to overcrowding, traffic congestion, and the growth of informal settlements in urban areas. At the same time, rural communities are left behind, with fewer workers and limited development. This brain drain makes it harder for provinces to grow economically, as skilled individuals prefer to work in Manila or even abroad.
        </p>
        <p>The lack of industries in rural regions is partly caused by poor infrastructure and limited investments. Companies are hesitant to expand outside the capital because of unstable power supply, unreliable internet, and limited transportation. Even when jobs are available in the provinces, they often pay significantly less than similar jobs in the city. Teachers, nurses, and other professionals in rural areas usually earn lower salaries, discouraging them from staying long-term.
        </p>
        <p>This inequality also affects families. Children from poor provinces often dream of working in Manila or overseas, perpetuating the cycle of migration. Meanwhile, the government’s job creation programs have not been enough to balance opportunities nationwide. If high-paying industries such as technology, manufacturing, and services were developed outside Metro Manila, regional growth could reduce poverty and make opportunities more inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>Without addressing the imbalance in job distribution, the Philippines risks widening the gap between city dwellers and rural communities, leaving millions of Filipinos excluded from economic progress.

        <h3>Dependence on Agriculture in Rural Areas, Where Wages are Low and Unstable</h3>
        <p>Agriculture remains the backbone of many rural communities in the Philippines, yet it is also one of the weakest sectors of the economy. Millions of farmers and fisherfolk rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, but their incomes are often low, unstable, and highly dependent on weather conditions. Despite being food producers, many rural families live in poverty because the prices of crops and fish are unpredictable, and middlemen often take a large share of the profits.
        </p>
        <p>Farmers also face challenges in land ownership, access to modern equipment, and lack of government support. Traditional farming methods limit productivity, while imported products compete with local harvests. For example, rice farmers struggle with the influx of cheaper rice imports under trade liberalization, leaving them unable to recover their production costs. The lack of cold storage and post-harvest facilities also leads to food wastage, further reducing income.
        </p>
        <p>Natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, and droughts hit farmers the hardest, wiping out months of labor in just a few days. Climate change has also made agriculture less predictable, pushing many young people to abandon farming and look for other work. This leaves the sector aging, with fewer young farmers willing to take over.
        </p>
        <p>Because wages in agriculture are so low, rural families cannot afford proper education or healthcare, perpetuating poverty from one generation to the next. Some farmers end up working as seasonal laborers, migrating from one plantation to another without job security. Programs like the Department of Agriculture’s modernization efforts aim to improve productivity, but implementation has been slow.
        </p>
        <p>Unless agriculture is given stronger support through subsidies, better infrastructure, access to technology, and fairer trade policies. Filipino farmers will remain poor, and rural inequality will persist.

        <h3>Informal Sector Employment With no Benefits or Job Security</h3>
        <p>The informal sector makes up a large portion of the Philippine economy, providing jobs for millions of Filipinos. Street vendors, jeepney and tricycle drivers, construction workers, and household helpers are among those who earn their living without formal contracts. While these jobs provide income, they lack stability, benefits, and legal protection. Workers in the informal sector are highly vulnerable to sudden loss of income, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdowns stopped public transportation and closed small businesses.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike formal employees, informal workers do not receive health insurance, paid leave, retirement benefits, or job security. Many live on a day-to-day basis, earning just enough to buy food for their families. Because their incomes are irregular, they often fall into debt, borrowing money from informal lenders at high interest rates. Children of informal workers may also be forced to drop out of school to help their parents earn money.
        </p>
        <p>The informal economy persists because of the lack of enough formal jobs. Many Filipinos, especially in rural areas, cannot meet the qualifications for office jobs due to limited education. Others are discouraged by low wages in formal employment, preferring the flexibility of informal work even if it lacks protection.</p>
        <p>Government programs such as microfinance and livelihood projects attempt to support informal workers, but these are not enough to provide long-term stability. To address this, the Philippines needs to create more sustainable and formal job opportunities, while providing training and social protection for informal workers. Otherwise, the cycle of poverty and insecurity will continue to trap millions in vulnerable conditions.

        <h3>Concentration of Industries in Metro Manila and Nearby Provinces</h3>
        <p>Economic growth in the Philippines is heavily centered on Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces, creating a serious imbalance in national development. The capital region is home to the largest companies, financial institutions, and industrial hubs, while many other provinces remain underdeveloped. This concentration of industries means that most investments, job opportunities, and infrastructure projects flow into a small portion of the country, leaving rural areas struggling to catch up.
        </p>
        <p>Metro Manila continues to attract investors because of its existing infrastructure, skilled labor force, and proximity to government offices. However, this creates a cycle where businesses prefer to stay in Manila, while provinces are left with little economic activity. As a result, many Filipinos migrate to the capital in search of work, worsening traffic, congestion, and housing problems.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, rural areas remain dependent on agriculture and small-scale trade. Lack of industries in the countryside limits employment opportunities and keeps wages low. Even government infrastructure projects like highways and airports are often concentrated in Luzon, giving fewer benefits to Visayas and Mindanao. This uneven distribution of industries leads to regional inequality and hinders inclusive growth.
        </p>
        <p>For true national development, industries must expand to other regions. Establishing manufacturing hubs, call centers, and technology parks outside Luzon can help balance the economy. If provinces are given better infrastructure and investment support, Filipinos would no longer need to migrate to Manila, and growth would be more evenly shared across the country.

        <h3>Unequal Access to Credit and Loans</h3>
        <p>Small businesses struggle to secure financial support, while large corporations easily access banks. Entrepreneurs often rely on informal lenders with high interest.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Reliance on Remittances</h3>
        <p>Overseas workers boost the economy, but this benefits only families with OFWs. It widens gaps between households and weakens local job creation.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Land Ownership Inequality</h3>
        <p>Despite agrarian reform, many farmers remain landless, limiting productivity and perpetuating rural poverty.</p>
