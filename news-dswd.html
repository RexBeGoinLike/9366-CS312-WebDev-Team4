            The Philippine government has announced the largest expansion of its Social Amelioration Program (SAP), aiming to support at least five million families across the country. This comes as inflation and rising food and fuel prices continue to affect the most vulnerable sectors of society.

            The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) confirmed that funds will be distributed through the AKAP payout system, prioritizing families in rural provinces and urban poor communities. Officials emphasized that the expansion is part of the government’s broader poverty reduction plan.

            “We want to ensure that no Filipino family is left behind in these challenging times,” said the DSWD Secretary. The department also assured transparency in fund distribution and highlighted its partnership with local governments to ensure aid reaches intended beneficiaries.

            Beneficiaries will receive financial assistance that can be used for food, medicine, and other basic needs. The government also aims to strengthen long-term livelihood programs to reduce dependence on aid.
