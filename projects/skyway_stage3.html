        <h2>Skyway Stage 3: A New Expressway Spine for Metro Manila</h2>
        <p class="byline">By TransparencyPH Staff | Updated September 2025</p>
        <img src="../pictures/skyway stage 3.webp" alt="Skyway Stage 3" class="article-img" />
        <p><strong>Skyway Stage 3</strong> is a major elevated expressway that connects the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) to the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), running 18 kilometers across Metro Manila. Completed in late 2020, it provides a crucial alternative to EDSA, cutting travel time from Quezon City to Makati from nearly 2 hours to just 20 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Project Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Quezon City to Makati, Metro Manila</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> ✅ Completed (December 2020)</li>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 18 kilometers</li>
            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> ₱44.86 billion</li>
            <li><strong>Developer:</strong> San Miguel Corporation Infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Timeline:</strong> 2014–2020</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background & Rationale</h3>
        <p>Metro Manila has long suffered from some of the worst traffic congestion in the world. Skyway Stage 3 was envisioned as the missing north-south expressway link, providing motorists with a high-capacity, limited-access road to bypass gridlocked city streets and improve the movement of goods and people.</p>

        <h3>Construction Highlights & Challenges</h3>
        <p>Construction faced numerous challenges, including right-of-way disputes, alignment changes, and delays caused by fires in construction areas. Despite these, the project was completed and opened for public use ahead of the government’s original timetable.</p>
        <p>The expressway features multiple entry and exit ramps, elevated viaducts passing over rivers and residential areas, and seismic design standards to withstand earthquakes.</p>

        <h3>Economic & Social Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Drastic reduction in travel time between NLEX and SLEX corridors.</li>
            <li>Improved logistics efficiency for businesses relying on north-south transport.</li>
            <li>Increased property values and economic activity in areas near access ramps.</li>
            <li>Decongestion of EDSA, C-5, and other major thoroughfares.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental & Community Considerations</h3>
        <p>Skyway Stage 3 required the relocation of some residents and businesses. The developer implemented compensation and relocation assistance programs in coordination with government agencies. Environmental management measures included dust suppression, noise reduction, and monitoring of air quality during construction.</p>

        <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>The expressway is part of a broader elevated Skyway system that continues to expand. Extensions and connector projects will further link Metro Manila’s toll road network, integrating with the North–South Commuter Railway and other expressways to form a seamless transportation backbone.</p>
