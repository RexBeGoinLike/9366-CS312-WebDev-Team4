        <h2>New Clark City: Building the Philippines’ Green and Smart Metropolis</h2>
        <p class="byline">By TransparencyPH Staff | Updated September 2025</p>
        <img src="../pictures/new clark city.jpg" alt="New Clark City" class="article-img" />
        <p><strong>New Clark City (NCC)</strong> is envisioned as the Philippines’ first smart, green, and disaster-resilient metropolis. Located in Capas, Tarlac, within the Clark Special Economic Zone, it is designed to decongest Metro Manila and provide a new center for government, business, and innovation.</p>

        <h3>Project Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Capas, Tarlac (within Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone)</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> Phase 1 completed; expansion phases ongoing</li>
            <li><strong>Land Area:</strong> 9,450 hectares</li>
            <li><strong>Key Facilities:</strong> Government Administrative Center, Athletics Stadium, Aquatics Center</li>
            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> ₱1.2 trillion (multi-phase, long-term development)</li>
            <li><strong>Implementing Agency:</strong> Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA)</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2016–2065 (planned build-out)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background & Rationale</h3>
        <p>Metro Manila faces overpopulation, congestion, flooding, and seismic risks. New Clark City was conceptualized to provide a modern alternative, spreading development to Central Luzon while boosting resilience against natural disasters. The site’s strategic location—accessible via expressways, Clark Airport, and future railways—makes it ideal for becoming a new growth hub.</p>

        <h3>Phase 1 Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Completion of world-class sports facilities used in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.</li>
            <li>Establishment of the National Government Administrative Center (NGAC) to house backup offices for government continuity during disasters.</li>
            <li>Initial residential and commercial developments to accommodate workers and residents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic & Social Impact</h3>
        <p>New Clark City is expected to attract investments in IT, manufacturing, logistics, and green industries. It will host hundreds of thousands of residents and workers in a master-planned environment with integrated public transport, renewable energy, and open green spaces.</p>

        <h3>Environmental & Community Considerations</h3>
        <p>The project emphasizes sustainability through solar farms, waste-to-energy facilities, water recycling, and smart-grid infrastructure. Resettlement programs for local communities, including Aeta groups, are ongoing with livelihood and housing support provided by the government.</p>

        <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>By 2065, New Clark City is projected to be home to over 1 million people and serve as a model for sustainable urbanization in Southeast Asia. Its integration with the North–South Commuter Railway and Clark International Airport will strengthen its role as a regional hub.</p>
