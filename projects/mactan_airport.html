        <h2>Mactan–Cebu International Airport Expansion Elevates Travel Experience</h2>
        <p class="byline">By TransparencyPH Staff | Published July 2018 | Updated 2025</p>
        <img src="../pictures/mactan airport.png" alt="Mactan Airport Expansion" class="article-img" />
        <p>The <strong>Mactan–Cebu International Airport (MCIA)</strong> expansion has positioned Cebu as a premier international gateway to the Philippines. With the opening of Terminal 2 in 2018 and ongoing upgrades to facilities, MCIA has become a model for public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the aviation sector.</p>

        <h3>Project Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> Terminal 2 completed (2018); continuous upgrades ongoing</li>
            <li><strong>Developer/Operator:</strong> GMR–Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC)</li>
            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> ₱17.5 billion for Terminal 2; additional investments for expansion and modernization</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2014–present (PPP concession runs for 25 years)</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Terminal 2 features a modern “resort-airport” concept, with extensive use of wood, glass, and natural light</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background & Rationale</h3>
        <p>Cebu has grown as a major tourist destination and business hub in the Visayas. MCIA’s original terminal was struggling with overcapacity, handling more than twice its design volume. The expansion, implemented through a PPP, aimed to enhance passenger experience, improve connectivity, and support Cebu’s growing role in regional development.</p>

        <h3>Construction Highlights & Challenges</h3>
        <p>Terminal 2 was constructed adjacent to the existing terminal while keeping the airport operational. Engineering challenges included ensuring uninterrupted flight operations, coordinating complex logistics, and sourcing sustainable materials. The project was completed on time and opened in July 2018.</p>

        <h3>Features & Passenger Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Terminal 2 capacity: up to 12.5 million passengers annually.</li>
            <li>Expanded immigration, check-in, and baggage handling systems.</li>
            <li>Resort-inspired architecture showcasing Cebu’s cultural identity.</li>
            <li>Upgraded retail, dining, and passenger lounge facilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Economic & Social Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boosted Cebu’s connectivity to over 25 international destinations and 30 domestic routes.</li>
            <li>Increased tourist arrivals, benefiting hotels, resorts, and local businesses.</li>
            <li>Generated thousands of direct and indirect jobs in aviation and tourism industries.</li>
            <li>Encouraged further foreign and local investments in Cebu’s economy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>Plans include a second runway, further expansion of passenger capacity, and adoption of green airport technologies. By 2030, MCIA aims to handle over 30 million passengers annually, consolidating Cebu’s role as a global hub for tourism and commerce.</p>
