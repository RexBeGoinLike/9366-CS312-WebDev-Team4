        <h2>Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway Opens to Traffic</h2>
        <p class="byline">By TransparencyPH Staff | Published April 27, 2022 | Updated 2025</p>
        <img src="../pictures/cebu cordova link.jpg" alt="Cebu Cordova Link Expressway" class="article-img" />
        <p>The <strong>Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX)</strong> is the longest and most ambitious bridge project in the Visayas. Stretching 8.9 kilometers across the Mactan Channel, it connects Cebu City to the municipality of Cordova in Mactan Island. Officially inaugurated in April 2022, CCLEX has transformed mobility, commerce, and tourism in Central Visayas.</p>

        <h3>Project Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Cebu City to Cordova, Cebu</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> Completed (April 27, 2022)</li>
            <li><strong>Contractor:</strong> Cebu Cordova Link Expressway Corporation (CCLEC), a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Tollways</li>
            <li><strong>Budget:</strong> ₱30 billion (private sector investment)</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2017–2022</li>
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Cable-stayed bridge with iconic crosses atop pylons, designed for resilience against typhoons and earthquakes</li>
            <li><strong>Toll system:</strong> Fully electronic RFID-enabled collection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background & Rationale</h3>
        <p>Before CCLEX, motorists relied on two existing bridges connecting Cebu and Mactan, both heavily congested during peak hours. The project aimed to relieve congestion, improve airport access, and provide a reliable link for logistics and commuters. It is part of Cebu’s long-term strategy to support economic growth, especially as Mactan hosts the international airport and thriving export-processing zones.</p>

        <h3>Construction Highlights & Challenges</h3>
        <p>Construction began in 2017 and involved marine engineering, deep foundation work, and precision installation of cable stays and road decks. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and workforce deployment, but strict health protocols and adaptive scheduling kept the project on track.</p>
        <p>The bridge’s design integrates 40-meter-high navigational clearance, accommodating maritime traffic in the busy Cebu Strait. The pylons, topped with illuminated crosses, serve as a symbolic marker of Cebu’s Catholic heritage.</p>

        <h3>Economic & Social Impact</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Travel time between Cebu City and Cordova reduced from up to 1 hour to just 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Boost to tourism, providing faster access to Mactan’s resorts and beaches.</li>
            <li>Enhanced logistics efficiency for exporters and manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Creation of thousands of construction and indirect jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental & Community Considerations</h3>
        <p>Environmental compliance included mangrove replanting programs, water quality monitoring, and fisheries compensation plans. Local communities received livelihood assistance and infrastructure improvements as part of the project’s corporate social responsibility commitments.</p>

        <h3>Future Outlook</h3>
        <p>CCLEX is expected to catalyze development in southern Metro Cebu, spur investments in Cordova, and contribute to Cebu’s positioning as a global hub. Expansion of feeder roads and integration with planned expressways are under discussion.</p>
