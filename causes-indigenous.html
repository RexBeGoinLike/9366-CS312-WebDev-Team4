        <h3>Land Displacement and Ancestral Domain</h3>
        <p>Many indigenous peoples are displaced from their ancestral lands due to mining, logging, and government projects. Despite the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA), implementation remains weak, leaving communities vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Lack of Access to Education and Healthcare</h3>
        <p>Indigenous children often lack access to quality education, while remote communities face poor healthcare services. This deepens the cycle of poverty and inequality, keeping many indigenous groups socially excluded.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Discrimination and Cultural Marginalization</h3>
        <p>Indigenous peoples face prejudice and cultural erasure. Their traditions, languages, and ways of life are often ignored or undervalued, making it harder for them to be recognized and supported in national development programs.</p>
