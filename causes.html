        <h2>Main Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Inequality in the Philippines has deep roots. Below are the biggest contributors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Inequality:</strong> The top 10% of families earn over 30% of national income, while the bottom 20% share less than 5%.</li>
            <li><strong>Education Gap:</strong> Children from poor families often drop out early and lack access to quality schools.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare Disparities:</strong> Rural areas lack hospitals, while urban centers have better access to doctors and medicines.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Divide:</strong> Luzon is far more developed than Mindanao, creating unequal opportunities for jobs and infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>Gender Inequality:</strong> Women often earn less than men and face barriers in leadership roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Corruption and Governance:</strong> Weak institutions and misuse of funds limit social protection programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cycle of Poverty</h3>
        <p>
            Many poor families remain poor for generations because they cannot afford education,
            healthcare, or capital to start businesses. This creates a cycle of poverty that is
            difficult to break without strong government intervention and social programs.
