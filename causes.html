            <h2>Causes of Inequality in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>
                Inequality in the Philippines is caused by the unequal distribution of wealth, where a few rich families and corporations control much of the economy. Limited access to quality education, healthcare, and decent jobs leaves rural and poor communities behind. Corruption and political dynasties weaken programs meant for the poor, while historical land ownership patterns and regional neglect keep provinces underdeveloped. Natural disasters, weak infrastructure, and the digital divide also worsen the gap between rich and poor.
