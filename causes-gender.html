        <h3>Wage Gap Between Men and Women</h3>
        <p>On average, women in the Philippines earn less than men for the same work. This wage gap is particularly evident in male-dominated industries such as construction, manufacturing, and technology. Even in sectors where women are the majority, like healthcare and education, they often occupy lower-paying roles compared to male counterparts in leadership positions.</p>

        <h3>Underrepresentation in Leadership</h3>
        <p>Although women play vital roles in society, they remain underrepresented in politics, corporate leadership, and high-level decision-making. Cultural norms and gender stereotypes continue to hinder women from pursuing leadership positions, perpetuating inequality in influence and opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Violence and Harassment</h3>
        <p>Women and girls experience gender-based violence and harassment both at home and in workplaces. Many cases go unreported due to fear, stigma, or lack of access to justice, further limiting women’s ability to thrive equally in society.</p>
