        <h2>Gender Inequality in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Despite progress in women’s rights, Filipino women still face discrimination in employment, wages, and access to opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Wage Gap Between Men and Women</h3>
        <p>Despite significant progress in promoting gender equality, the wage gap remains a persistent issue in the Philippines. On average, women earn 15% to 20% less than men for performing the same work, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). This gap is particularly visible in male-dominated fields such as construction, manufacturing, engineering, and technology, where men not only earn higher wages but also have better access to promotions and training opportunities. Even in industries where women constitute the majority — such as healthcare, education, and social work — they are often concentrated in lower-paying roles like teaching assistants, nurses, or clerical positions, while men dominate managerial and executive posts.

            Cultural expectations and gender roles contribute to this disparity. Women are often expected to shoulder unpaid domestic and caregiving responsibilities, which can limit their availability for full-time or high-level positions. Moreover, implicit biases in hiring, promotion, and salary negotiations further disadvantage women, leading to slower career advancement and reduced lifetime earnings. The wage gap is even more pronounced for women in rural areas or those from marginalized sectors, who may face additional barriers such as lack of education, transportation, and childcare support.

            Although laws like the Magna Carta of Women and Equal Pay for Equal Work provisions exist, enforcement remains inconsistent. Without stronger workplace policies, transparent pay practices, and cultural shifts toward valuing women’s labor equally, the wage gap will continue to reinforce gender inequality across generations.</p>

        <h3>Underrepresentation in Leadership</h3>
        <p>Women in the Philippines have made strides in politics, business, and public service, yet they remain significantly underrepresented in leadership positions. Despite the country electing two female presidents and having women in key cabinet posts, only about 28% of elective positions nationwide are currently held by women. In the corporate world, the numbers are even lower — less than 20% of top executive roles are occupied by women, and many boardrooms remain male-dominated. This imbalance limits women’s ability to shape policy, influence decisions, and advocate for gender-sensitive programs and reforms.

            Cultural norms and traditional gender roles remain powerful barriers. Many women are discouraged from pursuing leadership positions due to stereotypes that view men as “natural leaders” and women as more suited for supportive or caregiving roles. Work-life balance pressures, particularly around motherhood and domestic responsibilities, further reduce opportunities for women to climb the career ladder. Even when women do reach leadership positions, they often face gender bias, microaggressions, and a “glass ceiling” that restricts their upward mobility.

            Programs promoting women’s leadership, mentorship opportunities, and gender diversity policies in both public and private sectors have been introduced, but progress is slow. Experts argue that systemic reforms — including gender quotas, inclusive hiring policies, and leadership training — are needed to level the playing field. Empowering women to lead is not just a matter of equality; it also results in better governance, more inclusive policies, and stronger economic growth.</p>

        <h3>Violence and Harassment</h3>
        <p>Gender-based violence and harassment remain pervasive problems in the Philippines, affecting millions of women and girls across all social classes. Domestic violence, sexual harassment, human trafficking, and online abuse continue to rise despite legal protections under the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act (RA 9262) and the Safe Spaces Act. According to government data, 1 in 4 Filipino women has experienced physical, sexual, or emotional violence from a partner. Yet many incidents go unreported due to fear of retaliation, shame, cultural stigma, or distrust in the justice system.

            In the workplace, sexual harassment and gender discrimination are widespread but often dismissed as “normal” or “harmless.” Many women fear losing their jobs or damaging their reputations if they speak out. Online spaces have also become dangerous, with women frequently targeted by cyberstalking, doxxing, and sexualized abuse. These forms of violence not only violate human rights but also limit women’s participation in education, employment, and public life.

            The Philippine government and civil society groups continue to push for stronger implementation of existing laws, more accessible support services, and widespread gender-sensitivity education. Shelters, hotlines, and legal aid centers are expanding, but resources remain insufficient, especially in rural and conflict-affected areas. Addressing violence and harassment requires not only legal enforcement but also a societal shift — one that dismantles harmful gender norms, empowers survivors, and ensures that all women can live free from fear and violence.</p>
