        <h2>Environmental Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Natural disasters and climate change heavily impact poor Filipinos who lack resources to recover. Infrastructure gaps make communities even more vulnerable.</p>

        <h3>Natural Disasters Disproportionately Affect Poor Families</h3>
        <p>The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, facing frequent typhoons, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. These natural disasters affect all Filipinos, but the poor are hit the hardest. Families living in makeshift houses near rivers, coastlines, or mountainsides are especially vulnerable because they cannot afford safer housing. When disasters strike, they often lose everything—homes, livelihoods, and sometimes even loved ones.</p>
        <p>Wealthier families usually recover faster since they have savings, insurance, or access to loans. In contrast, poor households have no financial safety nets. After a typhoon, they may live in evacuation centers for months, depending on government aid that often arrives late or in limited supply. This delay worsens their already fragile situation.
        </p>
        <p>Livelihoods are also disrupted. Farmers lose crops to floods, while fisherfolk cannot go out to sea during storms. Small vendors lose their stalls and merchandise, leaving families with no source of income. Without capital to rebuild, many fall deeper into poverty.
        </p>
        <p>Children are among the most affected, as disasters disrupt schooling. Evacuation centers are often converted into temporary classrooms, but education is irregular. Health risks also increase due to poor sanitation, contaminated water, and lack of medicines.
        </p>
        <p>Unless stronger disaster-preparedness systems are implemented, poor families will remain trapped in a cycle of loss and recovery. Building resilient homes, improving early warning systems, and ensuring equal access to relief and rehabilitation are crucial steps to reducing inequality caused by disasters.

        <h3>Climate Change Threatens Agriculture, the main Livelihood of Rural Communities</h3>
        <p>Climate change has become one of the most serious threats to the Philippines, especially for rural communities that depend on farming and fishing. Rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, stronger typhoons, and droughts are already affecting agricultural productivity. Since a large portion of rural Filipinos rely on agriculture, these climate impacts worsen inequality between rural and urban populations.
        </p>
        <p>Farmers struggle with irregular planting and harvesting seasons. Crops like rice and corn are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall. Droughts dry up irrigation systems, while heavy rains flood farmlands. When harvests fail, farmers not only lose income but also face debts from loans used to buy seeds and fertilizers.
        </p>
        <p>Fisherfolk are also affected as climate change warms ocean waters and damages coral reefs. Fish stocks are declining, forcing fishermen to travel farther into dangerous waters. Many small-scale fishers cannot afford modern boats or equipment, limiting their catch and income.
        </p>
        <p>Urban families can still buy imported food, but rural families dependent on local harvests suffer hunger when crops fail. This widens the gap between rural and urban communities. Women and children in farming households are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>Addressing this requires stronger climate adaptation measures, such as crop diversification, sustainable fishing practices, and improved irrigation. Government support for climate-resilient agriculture, along with access to insurance, can help protect rural communities. Without urgent action, climate change will deepen poverty and inequality in the Philippines.

        <h3>Poor Infrastructure in Disaster Prone Areas Delays Recovery and Deepens Poverty</h3>
        <p>Infrastructure plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness and recovery, but many disaster-prone areas in the Philippines lack resilient infrastructure. Poorly built roads, weak bridges, and limited evacuation centers make it harder for vulnerable communities to survive and recover from calamities.
        </p>
        <p>In rural provinces, some barangays are isolated because roads are destroyed during floods or landslides. Relief goods take days to arrive, leaving families hungry and stranded. Weak bridges collapse during heavy rains, cutting off transportation and trade. Poor infrastructure not only delays recovery but also prevents long-term development.
        </p>
        <p>Housing is another major problem. Many poor families live in informal settlements made of light materials that are easily destroyed by strong winds or floods. Rebuilding becomes a repeated burden after every disaster, trapping families in poverty. In contrast, wealthier households can afford sturdier homes or relocate to safer areas.
        </p>
        <p>Healthcare infrastructure is also lacking. Rural health centers are often damaged during disasters and take months to repair. Without access to medicine or medical care, illnesses spread in evacuation sites. Children and elderly residents suffer the most.
        </p>
        <p>Education is similarly disrupted because schools double as evacuation centers, and damaged classrooms take time to rebuild. The lack of resilient infrastructure means poor children’s education is repeatedly interrupted, contributing to long-term inequality.
        </p>
        <p>To reduce disaster-driven inequality, the government must prioritize resilient infrastructure—stronger roads, permanent evacuation centers, climate-proof housing, and disaster-ready hospitals. Without these, poor communities will always recover more slowly, keeping them trapped in poverty while richer areas move forward.
