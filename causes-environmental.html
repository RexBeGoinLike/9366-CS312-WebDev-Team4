        <h2>Environmental Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Natural disasters and climate change heavily impact poor Filipinos who lack resources to recover. Infrastructure gaps make communities even more vulnerable.</p>

        <h3>Natural Disasters</h3>
        <p>Typhoons, floods, and earthquakes affect millions yearly. Poor families suffer the most as they live in unsafe housing and cannot easily rebuild after disasters.</p>

        <h3>Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Rising sea levels and unpredictable weather hurt farmers and fishers. Rural communities face food insecurity as agriculture becomes less stable.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Poor Infrastructure in Disaster Areas</h3>
        <p>Lack of strong roads, bridges, and evacuation centers slows recovery after disasters. Rural communities are left isolated for days or weeks during emergencies.</p>
