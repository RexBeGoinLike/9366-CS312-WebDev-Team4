        <h2>Technological & Infrastructure Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Technology and infrastructure are key to progress. Unequal access to internet, electricity, and transport deepens inequality between urban and rural communities.</p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <h3>Uneven Internet Access</h3>
        <p>Urban areas have faster internet, while many rural communities struggle with poor or no connectivity. Students and workers in remote provinces are left behind in the digital age.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Poor Transportation</h3>
        <p>Rural areas often lack reliable roads and public transport. This prevents access to schools, hospitals, and markets, isolating communities economically and socially.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Lack of Rural Electrification</h3>
        <p>Some barangays still lack stable electricity. Without power, healthcare, education, and local businesses cannot function effectively, widening the rural-urban divide.</p>
