        <h3>Urban vs. Rural Divide</h3>

        <h3>High Cost of Medical Care</h3>
        <p>Even with PhilHealth, many Filipinos cannot afford quality healthcare. Out-of-pocket expenses for medicine, hospital stays, and treatments push families into debt, especially those already living in poverty.</p>

        <p>Many Filipino doctors and nurses migrate abroad for better pay, leaving local hospitals understaffed. This healthcare worker shortage especially affects rural communities, making services inconsistent and often inaccessible.</p>
