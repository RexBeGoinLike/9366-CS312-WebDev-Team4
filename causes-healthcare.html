        <h2>Healthcare Access Inequality</h2>
        <p>Access to healthcare in the Philippines is highly unequal, with rural areas and poor families left behind.</p>

        <h3>Urban vs. Rural Divide</h3>
        <p>Healthcare access in the Philippines is heavily skewed in favor of urban areas, highlighting a deep inequality between city dwellers and rural communities. Most hospitals, specialized medical facilities, and advanced diagnostic centers are concentrated in Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, and other major cities, leaving vast provinces with only basic health units or poorly equipped municipal clinics. In many remote areas, residents have to travel several hours — or even days — to reach the nearest hospital capable of handling serious medical cases. For low-income families, transportation costs alone can make medical care inaccessible, leading many to delay or forgo treatment altogether.

            This urban-centric distribution of healthcare services means that rural Filipinos often rely on barangay health stations that may lack essential medicines, diagnostic equipment, and trained personnel. Preventive care, maternal services, and emergency response are particularly limited. Pregnant women, for example, face higher maternal and infant mortality risks due to inadequate prenatal care and the absence of skilled birth attendants. The inequality is further exacerbated during public health emergencies, such as disease outbreaks or natural disasters, where rural areas often experience delayed government response and insufficient medical supplies.</p>

        <h3>High Cost of Medical Care</h3>
        <p>The cost of healthcare remains a major barrier for millions of Filipinos, even with government programs like PhilHealth aiming to provide universal health coverage. Many medical services, including specialist consultations, diagnostic tests, surgeries, and long-term treatments, require significant out-of-pocket payments. For families living below the poverty line, a single hospitalization can consume months or even years of income. As a result, some patients resort to self-medication, borrowing money, or selling assets to cover medical bills — pushing them deeper into the cycle of poverty.

            While PhilHealth provides partial coverage for many treatments, it often falls short of covering the total cost. Patients must still shoulder expenses for medicines, laboratory tests, and post-treatment care. Moreover, private hospitals — which offer higher-quality services — charge fees that are unaffordable to the majority of Filipinos. This leads to stark disparities in the quality of care received by rich and poor patients. Wealthier individuals have access to world-class healthcare and state-of-the-art treatments, while the poor are left with underfunded public hospitals and long waiting times.</p>

        <h3>Shortage of Healthcare Workers</h3>
        <p>The Philippines faces a chronic shortage of healthcare workers, particularly in rural and underserved regions. Thousands of Filipino doctors, nurses, and medical technicians migrate abroad each year in search of better salaries and working conditions. While this contributes significantly to the country’s remittance economy, it leaves local healthcare systems severely understaffed. Rural hospitals often operate with a skeleton workforce, forcing one doctor or nurse to serve thousands of patients. In some remote barangays, residents may see a doctor only a few times a year — if at all.

            This shortage directly affects the quality and consistency of healthcare services. Patients experience long waiting times, reduced consultation hours, and limited access to specialized care. Preventive healthcare programs, such as vaccination drives and health education campaigns, are also less effective due to the lack of manpower. The government has launched programs like Doctors to the Barrios and Nurse Deployment Projects to address these gaps, but retention remains a challenge as many health workers still seek employment overseas. Addressing this crisis requires better salaries, safer working conditions, and incentives for medical professionals to serve in rural communities.</p>
