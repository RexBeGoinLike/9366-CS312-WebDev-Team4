        <h2>Social Causes of Inequality</h2>
        <p>Social inequality limits opportunities for education, healthcare, and fair treatment. Below are some of the most pressing issues.</p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <h3>Poor Access to Quality Education</h3>
        <p>Rural schools lack proper facilities, teachers, and funding. Many students walk long distances to attend classes. Urban private schools provide advanced programs, creating a large learning gap between rural and city students.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Shortage of Healthcare Services</h3>
        <p>Provinces suffer from understaffed hospitals and lack of doctors. Poor families often rely on barangay health workers with limited supplies, leaving them vulnerable in times of crisis.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Discrimination Against Indigenous Peoples</h3>
        <p>Indigenous groups face exclusion from jobs, education, and healthcare. Many are displaced from their ancestral lands, further worsening poverty and inequality.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
        <p>Women often earn less and have fewer leadership opportunities. They also bear the burden of unpaid household work alongside employment, limiting their advancement.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Urban-Rural Divide</h3>
        <p>Cities enjoy better infrastructure and opportunities, while rural areas are left behind. This fuels migration to urban centers and causes brain drain in the provinces.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Limited Social Mobility</h3>
        <p>Children from poor families struggle to break the cycle of poverty due to malnutrition, poor education, and lack of access to stable jobs.</p>
