        <h3>Economic Inequality</h3>
        <p>
            The Philippines has one of the highest inequality rates in Southeast Asia.
            The <strong>Gini coefficient</strong> stood at around <strong>42.3%</strong> in 2018,
            showing wide income disparities. The <strong>top 1%</strong> of earners capture about
            <strong>17% of national income</strong>, while the bottom 50% share only 14%.
            Although poverty fell from 49.2% in 1985 to 16.7% in 2018, income gaps remain.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Social Inequality</h3>
        <p>
            Social inequality is visible in education and labor opportunities. Many Filipinos still
            face job insecurity and limited access to higher education. Out-of-school youth reached
            <strong>2.2 million</strong> in 2022. In addition, the Philippines ranks
            <strong>102 out of 161</strong> countries in Oxfam’s Global Inequality Index for 2022,
            reflecting weak policies on labor, taxation, and public services.

        <h3>Health Inequality</h3>
        <p>
            Health outcomes are unequal between rich and poor Filipinos. About <strong>28.8%</strong> of children
            under five years old are stunted (2019), mainly due to malnutrition and lack of access to healthcare.
            Wealthier Filipinos also face lifestyle-related illnesses: a study showed higher cardiovascular risks among
            the richest groups due to elevated cholesterol and glucose levels.

    <section>
        <h3>Environmental Inequality</h3>
        <p>
            Environmental degradation and climate disasters disproportionately affect the poor.
            Typhoons, floods, and rising sea levels hit low-income households hardest due to unsafe housing
            and lack of resources. In rural areas, poor families rely heavily on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture,
            worsening the cycle of poverty.
