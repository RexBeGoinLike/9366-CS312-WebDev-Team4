        <h3>Unequal Representation in Politics</h3>
        <p>Political dynasties dominate elections. As a result, laws and policies often favor wealthy elites, leaving marginalized communities unheard.</p>
    </article>

        <h3>Weak Implementation of Pro-Poor Laws</h3>
        <p>Programs like PhilHealth and the 4Ps suffer from bureaucracy and corruption, limiting their intended benefits for the poor.</p>

        <h3>Centralized Governance</h3>

    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Patronage Politics</h3>
        <p>Politicians often distribute benefits based on loyalty rather than need. This creates unfair systems where ordinary citizens are left behind.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Peace and Security Issues</h3>
