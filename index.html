        <h2>Bridging the Gap: Understanding Inequality</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippines is one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies, yet millions of Filipinos remain in poverty.
            Inequality—whether in income, education, healthcare, or opportunities—continues to divide the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website provides insights into the causes, statistics, and ongoing efforts to address inequality
            in the Philippines. Together, we can build a society where growth is shared by everyone.

        <h3>What is Inequality?</h3>
        <p>
            Inequality is not just about being rich or poor. It is the unfair gap between people
            who have access to resources and opportunities, and those who don’t. In the Philippines,
            this gap is seen in many aspects of life. Below are the four major types:
        </p>

        <!-- Income Inequality -->
        <h4>1) High Income Inequality</h4>
        <p>
            Income inequality remains one of the biggest challenges in the Philippines. Studies show
            that the richest 10% of Filipinos hold more wealth than the poorest 50% combined. This gap
            is visible in everyday life—from luxurious gated communities and high-rise condominiums in
            Metro Manila to informal settlements in urban and rural areas. The disparity is partly fueled
            by unequal access to job opportunities. High-paying jobs are concentrated in business districts
            and industries like finance, real estate, and technology, while many workers in agriculture and
            manufacturing earn only minimum wage. Remittances from overseas Filipino workers help many poor
            families, but they are not enough to close the wealth gap. Tax policies and corruption have also
            been criticized for favoring wealthy elites. Poverty reduction programs exist, yet many marginalized
            groups, such as indigenous communities and informal settlers, remain excluded. Ultimately, inequality
            continues to limit social mobility and widens the divide between rich and poor Filipinos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many rural households survive only on subsistence farming. Informal workers in markets, construction,
            and transportation often lack social protection. Natural disasters also deepen inequality, as poor
            families struggle to recover from typhoons and floods. The concentration of wealth in a few families
            has led to political dynasties maintaining power. Meanwhile, small entrepreneurs face barriers in
            accessing loans and markets. Inequality also affects children, as those born into poor families have
            fewer chances to break out of poverty. Addressing income inequality is crucial for inclusive and
            sustainable development.

        <!-- Education Inequality -->
        <h4>2) Education Inequality</h4>
        <p>
            Education in the Philippines is supposed to be a great equalizer, but inequality is still evident.
            Rural and poor students often face limited access to quality schools, classrooms, and teachers. In
            remote provinces, children walk several kilometers just to attend classes. Many schools lack proper
            facilities such as libraries, science laboratories, and internet connection. This makes it harder for
            students in the provinces to compete with students in urban centers who enjoy better resources.
            Financial challenges also push many poor students to drop out early to help their families earn a living.
            Government programs like free tuition in state universities and school feeding programs aim to improve
            access, but these are not enough to fully bridge the gap. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the inequality
            further, as poor students struggled with online classes due to lack of gadgets and stable internet.
            Education inequality continues to threaten the chances of many Filipino children to escape poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teachers in rural areas are often underpaid and overworked. Many public schools rely on community donations
            to provide basic materials like chairs and books. Students in coastal and mountain barangays sometimes face
            school closures due to floods and landslides. While urban private schools offer robotics and advanced science
            classes, rural schools often lack even basic electricity. Language barriers also create inequality, as indigenous
            students struggle with Tagalog or English instruction. Scholarships are available but remain limited and highly
            competitive. Unless systemic reforms are made, education will continue to reflect social inequality.
        </p>

        <!-- Healthcare Inequality -->
        <h4>3) Healthcare Inequality</h4>
        <p>
            Healthcare services in the Philippines are unevenly distributed. Metro Manila and other major cities have
            better hospitals, doctors, and advanced medical equipment. In contrast, many provinces—especially in Mindanao
            and far-flung Visayas islands—suffer from a shortage of healthcare professionals and medicines. Rural health
            centers are often understaffed and lack proper facilities. Patients sometimes travel hours to reach the nearest
            functioning hospital. Even when government hospitals are available, long waiting times and lack of supplies make
            healthcare access difficult for poor Filipinos. The cost of private hospitals remains unaffordable for many families.
            While PhilHealth provides coverage, not all expenses are shouldered, leaving patients burdened with high out-of-pocket
            costs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, inequality became more visible as urban hospitals reached capacity, while rural
            areas lacked even basic protective equipment. Healthcare inequality in the Philippines continues to put the most
            vulnerable at risk, particularly the poor, elderly, and those living in remote areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many doctors prefer to work abroad due to low salaries locally. Midwives and barangay health workers often serve
            as the first and only line of care in rural towns. Access to maternal and child healthcare remains a problem in
            isolated communities. Vaccination rates are lower in geographically isolated areas. Poor infrastructure, such as
            lack of roads, delays emergency care in many provinces. Some indigenous peoples avoid hospitals due to cultural
            barriers and mistrust. Without equitable healthcare access, health outcomes will remain divided between the rich
            and poor.
        </p>

        <!-- Regional Inequality -->
        <h4>4) Regional Inequality</h4>
        <p>
            The Philippines faces strong regional inequality, with Metro Manila and nearby provinces developing much faster
            than the rest of the country. The National Capital Region (NCR) is the center of business, government, and education.
            It attracts investments and jobs, leading to higher income levels. In contrast, Mindanao remains underdeveloped
            despite its rich natural resources. Many areas suffer from poor infrastructure, limited electricity, and unstable
            internet connectivity. Armed conflict and political instability in some parts of Mindanao have also discouraged
            investors. The Visayas, while more developed than Mindanao, still lags behind Luzon in terms of industrial growth
            and opportunities. This imbalance drives internal migration, as people from rural provinces move to Metro Manila
            in search of better jobs, worsening congestion and poverty in the city. Government projects like the “Build, Build,
            Build” program and efforts to promote federalism aim to reduce inequality, but progress is slow. Regional inequality
            continues to hinder balanced national development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many provinces rely heavily on agriculture, which keeps incomes low and unstable. Tourism potential in regions like
            Palawan and Bohol remains underutilized due to poor infrastructure. Metro Manila receives a disproportionate share of
            the national budget compared to far-flung regions. Businesses are hesitant to invest in conflict-prone areas despite
            incentives. Migration leaves some provinces with brain drain, as skilled workers move to Manila or abroad. Students
            from rural areas also relocate to big cities for college, further draining talent from the provinces. Balanced growth
            will only be achieved if resources and opportunities are spread across all regions.
