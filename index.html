        <h2>Bridging the Gap: A Closer Look at Inequality</h2>
        <p>
            The Philippines has one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia. Yet,
            millions of Filipinos still live below the poverty line. Inequality in income,
            education, healthcare, and access to opportunities continues to divide society.
            This website aims to spread awareness, share real data, and inspire action.

        <h3>Understanding the Issue</h3>
        <p>
            Inequality is more than just poverty—it is about unfair differences in wealth,
            resources, and opportunities. The Philippines struggles with regional disparities
            (Luzon vs. Mindanao), gender gaps, and lack of social protection for vulnerable
            groups. Addressing inequality means ensuring that growth benefits everyone, not
            just the wealthy.
